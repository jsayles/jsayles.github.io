Office Nomads is a coworking community in Capitol Hill, Seattle. We are dedicated to cultivating a dynamic, creative and collaborative environment for Seattle’s nomadic workforce. We believe that by working together we can accomplish more than we could alone. If you have the ability to work from anywhere, why not work alongside others? Working independently doesn’t mean sacrificing a support system.

I founded Office Nomads with my business partner Susan Evans in the summer of 2007.  We opened our doors that November and we've been growing ever since.  Today we are proud of our vibrant, diverse community and are lucky to be members of such an amazing network.
