This is a demo of a prototype I'm going to use for a Cascadia Map.  The idea is to have a map in Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland and that
when you press the button on your map, that city lights up on all 3 maps.  This prototype uses the Adafruit Feather Huzzah as the
development board and Adafruit.io as the data transport service.
