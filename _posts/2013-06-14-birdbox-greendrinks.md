For their 10th anniversary, Seattle Greendrinks commissioned us to create another Bird Box with the "simple" requirement that it was portable.  Their event moves around and they generally use a SmartCar from Car2Go.  Andrew and I worked our magic and fit the entire device in an antique suitcase complete with Edison bulb sconces, mechanical bell, LCD screen, and vintage charm.
