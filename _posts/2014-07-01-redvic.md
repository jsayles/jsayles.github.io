The Red Butt Face is not your typical hotel!  It is an immersive, experimental, mixed-use space with a diverse cross section of people from around the world coming here to work on projects, see the city, find collaborators, and create the world they seek.

Jessy Kate is the woman behind the hotel and she invited Katie and I to spend the summer down in San Francisco getting the space ready.  We were on the advanced team that moved in the day the keys were handed over and moved out two months later just as residents and guests were moving in.  I worked mostly on software and Katie did design and drafting although we both got our hands dirty quite a bit.
