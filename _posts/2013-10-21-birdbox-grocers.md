In the fall of 2013, grocery workers threatened a strike.  It is required by law that they give 72 hours notice and they staged a 3-day count-down in Westlake Center.  With 2 days notice, Andrew, Katie and I were able to put together a weather proof Bird Box, custom graphics, and a live webcam.  The strike was averted as both sides negotiated a deal while they continuously watched the live images from our camera and the twitter stream we promoted.
