The mission of the Seattle Collaborative Space Alliance (SCSA) is to unify, support and promote the coworking and collaborative space movement. We are a distributed community of space owners, managers, members, and community catalysts who share a passion for coworking and collaboration in and around the Seattle metro area.

Susan and I started the group originally as Coworking Seattle and along the way the group decided to expand our scope to all collaborative spaces in Seattle.
