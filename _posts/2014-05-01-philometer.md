I created a device that we call the Philometer from the Greek root 'philos', to love and 'metric', to measure.  It measures heart rate (BPM), brain activity (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and body temperature.  At it's heart is an Arduino and it uploads the data to a computer.  The data coming in to the computer is graphed in real time using Processing and simultaneously saved as a raw CSV file.  We can then graph the data in 3D using a python script that imports the data in to Rhino. Katie created Illustrator templates that further format the data into the final art piece.
