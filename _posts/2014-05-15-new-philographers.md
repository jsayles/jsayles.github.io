The New Philographers are an artist duo dedicated to the science of philometrics.  In this new science, we (the New Philographers) connect a subject up to an array of biometric sensors and gather data as the subject reacts to an external stimulus.  This data is then transformed into a 3-dimensional representation (a philograph) of the subject's experience.
