Modernomad is guest, event and community management software for coliving houses and other experimental living arrangements focused on openness, collaboration and participation.  

This is the open source platform behind The Embassy Network, built on python/Django.  Jessy is the primary developer and I've been working with her to make it more robust, scalable, and multi-tenant.
