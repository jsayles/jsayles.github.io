Nadine is an open source system for facilitating a coworking community.  There is a kiosk located at the front desk where members sign-in each day and new visitors are entered in the system.  Members can connect via the web interface, explore other members and what is happening around the space.  Staff members have rich data and statistics on how the business is running and dynamic, data-driven to-do lists to help new and exiting members.
