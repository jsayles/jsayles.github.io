With smartphones in everyone's pockets these days we have many ways to communicate
but I wanted to get back to basics.  I essentially recreated the telegram
here with one button and one haptic buzzer.  You press the button on Thing 1 and
Thing 2 vibrates and vice-versa.  The whole thing fits in the palm of your hand
and you can send and receive messages discretely, without having to look at
anything.  I did add an RGB LED for system status information.

These connect to each other using wifi so they need to be within range of each
other.  I could also program it to bounce up to a server and you could
communicate across the globe.  I had hoped to use morse code but the timing
would need to be improved to capture the nuances of each person's handle.

I used this as an opportunity to play with Circuit Python which works pretty
well on these little feather boards.  For my next project I'll buy a board
specifically designed for Circuit Python so I can access more of the features.
