We have an amazing view of English Bay from our apartment in Vancouver which
is also where the big ships park while they wait to be loaded up at the port.
The ultimate goal is to build a wall map patterned off the Manhattan Marauder's
Map I saw on Hackaday.  First things first, I needed to get the data and store
it in a database.  I'm using Django/Python and the data comes from Marine Traffic.
