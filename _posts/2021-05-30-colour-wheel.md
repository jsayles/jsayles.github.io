The family spent some time in West Virginia with Katie's folks and we
came up with a project Bruce and I could do together.  I wanted to create a
game that was engaging but not in the typical -bang- -pow- -beep- sort of way
most baby toys do it.  The concept is simple, an LED light ring and
three buttons, red, green, and blue.  You can even mix and match colours!

Bruce is a woodworker so the case he built for this was turned on his lathe.
He glued together some thick hard maple planks and turned out a 7" bowl, deep
enough to house all of the electronics. The top plate is 2 layers of clear
plexiglass with the inner surfaces sanded to defuse light.  The outer LED ring
is blocked by the top wood ring and the light is reflected into the center.

One design issue we ran into was that the Adafruit Circuit Playground boards
do not have a charging circuit. This means the external USB plug we added can
only be for programming or charging, not both.  I purchased a charging
board and when I get home I'll hook that up and it will be for charging only.
I'm sad about that because this hardware could do many fun things (simon says?)
but to reprogram it I'll need to take it all apart.
