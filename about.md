## Bio
I am a creative and entrepreneurial technologist with over 20 years of
experience and a history of innovative ideas, well executed projects,
and management of diverse teams.  In 2007, I recognized the growing trend of
independent and remote workers and opened Office Nomads, the first coworking
space in Seattle, WA.  To support this business and others like it, I wrote
Nadine, the first open source coworking platform, and founded Open Coworking,
a non-profit dedicated to the Coworking Movement.  In 2016 I relocated to
Vancouver, Canada to take on the role of Director of Technology for 312 Main,
a 105,000 sf coworking community in the old Downtown Vancouver Police building.

I am currently a partner at [Kanawha Design Studio](https://kanawha.design),
a consulting firm that supports small, medium, and large collaborative spaces
with business planning, operations, community development, IT infrastructure,
and the many uses of technology to support their memberships and communities.
